# Hi, I'm Antonio Kiepert 👋
**Marketing Manager | Growth & Paid Media**

> "I build growth engines that generate pipeline and real revenue."

I operate at the intersection of **strategy, execution, and automation**. I don't just run campaigns — I design systems that connect marketing, product, and sales to drive predictable results.

Currently leading marketing at [SlabWare](https://slabware.com), driving growth for the stone industry across the US and Brazil.

## 🚀 About Me

I bring a **global mindset** with 9 years of experience living in the US and running campaigns for both American and Brazilian markets.

My core expertise lies in:
*   **Growth & Demand Gen**: Acquisition funnels, free trials, and pipeline generation for SaaS & B2B.
*   **Paid Media Performance**: Managing Meta Ads, Google Ads, and YouTube Ads with a focus on ROI (achieved 150%+ ROI at SlabWare).
*   **Marketing Automation**: Implementing CRM stacks (Zoho), n8n automations, and lifecycle marketing.
*   **Technical Marketing**: Unlike traditional marketers, I use code **(React, TypeScript, Supabase, n8n)** to build internal tools like lead miners, production dashboards, and email dispatchers.
